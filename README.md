**End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction**

**Business Problem**

The telecommunications industry faces a significant challenge in managing customer churn, where customers discontinue their services. This churn leads to lost revenue and increased costs related to acquiring new customers. In the context of this report, we focus on a hypothetical telecommunications company aiming to understand and predict customer churn. By identifying at-risk customers, the company can develop targeted strategies to reduce churn, thereby increasing customer retention and enhancing profitability.

Churn refers to the behavior of customers who stop using a company's services within a specified period. It is a critical metric that directly impacts the companyâ€™s revenue and market share. For the telecommunications industry, churn is often associated with customers switching to competitors, which necessitates a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to this behavior.

**Importance**

Effectively managing customer attrition allows companies to develop strategies to retain clients. Identifying potential churners enables early interventions to increase customer satisfaction, adapt marketing strategies, and offer new services, which can help reduce churn, enhance customer loyalty, and improve financial outcomes.
